Challenge

Enable someone to accurately predict which photo will be the most popular out of a series of shots

Apart from all the extra validation youâ€™ll get on Instragram, the applications of solving this challenge are actually much further reaching that it seems. It could also save a huge amount of bandwidth, storage space. Reducing costs of image storage services, de-cluttering your camera roll and making sharing memories a much simpler, cleaner experience.


Primary Objective: Quickly highlight the most popular photo out of a series.

User Benefit: Users can post the images that others will enjoy the most.

Constraints: The prediction must take place within 10 seconds.
